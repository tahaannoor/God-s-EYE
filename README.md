God's EYE - Information Gathering Tool
<div>

God's EYE is an Information Gathering Tool I made in python 3. 
To run God's EYE, it only needs a domain or ip.
God's EYE can work with any Linux distros if they support Python 3.


# God's EYE gathers information data such as:

1.   Whois Lookup
2.   DNS Lookup
3.   EtherApe
4.   Nmap Port Scan
5.   HTTP Header Grabber
6.   Clickjacking Test
7.   Robots.txt Scanner
8.   Link Grabber
9.   IP Location Finder
10.  Traceroute
11.  Have I been pwned
12.  Exit
